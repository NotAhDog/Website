<h4 class="abouttext">
   This website is the official portfolio of Edward, showcasing a body of work that spans digital art, 
   <br>
   photography, printmaking, and elements of sculpture and painting. Edward’s creative practice is 
   <br>
   rooted in minimalism, often merging realistic and abstract approaches to explore themes that 
   <br>
   reflect his inner world and personal identity.
   <br><br>
   Each artwork presented here is part of a broader exploration — a visual language shaped by emotion, 
   <br>
   experience, and self-reflection. From experimental prints to quiet photographic studies and dynamic 
   <br>
   digital pieces, the portfolio captures a multidimensional artistic voice.
   <br><br>
   In addition to a curated selection of top artworks, the site highlights influential artist models who
   <br> 
    have shaped Edward’s vision and process. It’s a space to not only view the work, but to understand 
   <br>
   the thinking and inspiration behind it.

<h3 class="aboutmeheading">About Me</h3>
<h4 class="aboutme">
    My name is Edward Mathers, and I’m a multidisciplinary artist with a deep passion for visual 
    <br>
    expression and the endless possibilities of design. Art has always been a powerful outlet for me — a 
    <br>
    way to translate thoughts, emotions, and identity into something tangible and lasting.
    <br><br>
    My work is primarily rooted in a minimalistic style, often blending clean, simple forms with touches 
    <br>
    of realism. I enjoy exploring contrasts — the quietness of negative space paired with intricate details, 
    <br>
    or the balance between abstract forms and realistic representation. Each piece I create is a personal 
    <br>
    exploration, shaped by my experiences and evolving creative voice.
    <br><br>
    I'm constantly striving to improve and refine my skills through regular practice, experimentation, and 
    <br>
    learning from the artists who inspire me. My long-term goal is to become a tattoo artist, a field that 
    <br>
    has fascinated me for years. I’ve always been drawn to the powerful, personal nature of tattoos — how 
    <br>
    they carry stories, symbolism, and artistry on the canvas of the body.
    <br><br>
    This journey is ongoing, and this portfolio is both a reflection of where I am now and a stepping stone 
    <br>
    toward where I hope to go.
