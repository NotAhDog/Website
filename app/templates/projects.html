<h2 class="aboutheadings">Burnside High School Leavers Book</h2>
<h3 class="abouttext">
    During year 13 of Burnside High School I worked on and helped
    <br>
    to design the look of the book itself. The main pages that I
    <br>
    worked on was the signature page along with one of the class
    <br>
    that class being, MTR.
    <br><br>
    This is what the pages I designed turned out looking like:
</h3>
<h3 class="page2heading">13MTR Page:</h3>
<h3 class="page1heading">Signature Page:</h3>
<img class="leaversbookpages1" src="/static/images/pending.png" draggable="false"> <!-- Signature page image -->

<img class="leaversbookpages2" src="/static/images/mtrpage.png" draggable="false"> <!-- MTR page image -->
